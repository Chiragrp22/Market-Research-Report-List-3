<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photoelectric Micro Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Reflective Photoelectric Micro Sensor</li><li>Diffuse Photoelectric Micro Sensor</li><li>Through Beam Photoelectric Micro Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Photoelectric micro sensors are used in various industries for detecting objects or measuring distances. There are three main types of photoelectric micro sensors - reflective, diffuse, and through beam. Reflective sensors detect objects by reflecting light off the object back to the sensor. Diffuse sensors rely on the light reflected directly from the object being detected. Through beam sensors consist of a transmitter and receiver placed opposite to each other, detecting objects when the beam is interrupted. Each type has its own advantages and applications in different industries.</p></p>
