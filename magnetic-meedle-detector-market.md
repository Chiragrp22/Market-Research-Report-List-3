<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Magnetic Meedle Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Scroll</li><li>Non-Rolling</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Magnetic Needle Detector market encompasses two main types: Scroll and Non-Rolling. Scroll detectors utilize a scrolling mechanism to ensure proper alignment and movement of the magnetic needle. This type offers precise and accurate detection results. On the other hand, Non-Rolling detectors do not employ a scrolling mechanism and rely on alternative methods for needle detection. While generally less expensive, they may provide slightly less precise results. Both types are widely used in industries like garment manufacturing to detect and prevent potential hazards caused by stray magnetic needles during production processes.</p></p>
