<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Acrylic Emulsion Adhesives Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Volatile Curing</li><li>Water Curing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Acrylic emulsion adhesives are available in two main types: volatile curing and water curing. Volatile curing adhesives contain solvents that evaporate during the curing process, leaving behind a strong bond. Water curing adhesives, on the other hand, rely on water to cure and form a bond. Both types offer strong adhesive properties, but volatile curing adhesives may emit harmful fumes during the curing process. Water curing adhesives are considered more environmentally friendly due to their reliance on water for curing.</p></p>
