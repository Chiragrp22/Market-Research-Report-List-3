<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flame and Detonation Arrestor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vertical Flame and Detonation Arrestor</li><li>Horizontal Flame and Detonation Arrestor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Vertical Flame and Detonation Arrestors are designed to prevent the propagation of flames through a pipeline or duct, by forcing the flame to pass through a series of channels which absorb the heat and extinguish it. Horizontal Flame and Detonation Arrestors, on the other hand, are installed horizontally in a pipeline to prevent flame propagation in the event of a deflagration or detonation. Both types of arrestors play a critical role in industrial safety by preventing the spread of flames and protecting equipment and personnel.</p></p>
