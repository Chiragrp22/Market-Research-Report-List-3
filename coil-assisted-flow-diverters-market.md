<p><p>Coil Assisted Flow Diverters (CAFD) are medical devices used in the treatment of intracranial aneurysms. They are designed to redirect the flow of blood away from an aneurysm in order to prevent rupture and reduce the risk of hemorrhagic stroke. CAFDs are deployed through endovascular procedures, where they are inserted into the affected blood vessel and expanded to create a scaffold-like structure that diverts blood flow away from the aneurysm.</p><p>The global Coil Assisted Flow Diverters Market is projected to experience steady growth during the forecast period. The market is expected to expand at a CAGR of 3.30% due to factors such as the increasing prevalence of intracranial aneurysms and the rising adoption of minimally invasive procedures for their treatment. Additionally, advancements in CAFD technology, such as the development of bioactive and resorbable flow diverters, are driving market growth.</p><p>One of the latest trends in the market is the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms in CAFDs. AI-assisted CAFD systems can provide real-time monitoring and analysis of blood flow dynamics, enabling personalized treatment and improving clinical outcomes. Furthermore, manufacturers are focusing on developing next-generation CAFDs with enhanced navigability, flexibility, and visibility, which can simplify the deployment process and improve patient safety.</p><p>Geographically, North America dominates the CAFD market due to the high prevalence of intracranial aneurysms and the availability of advanced healthcare infrastructure. However, the Asia-Pacific region is expected to witness significant growth during the forecast period, attributed to the increasing healthcare expenditure, growing awareness about aneurysm treatments, and rising adoption of minimally invasive procedures in the region.</p><p>In conclusion, the Coil Assisted Flow Diverters Market is poised for growth in the coming years, driven by factors such as the rising prevalence of intracranial aneurysms, advancements in CAFD technology, and the integration of AI and ML algorithms. The market is expected to expand at a CAGR of 3.30% during the forecast period.</p></p>
