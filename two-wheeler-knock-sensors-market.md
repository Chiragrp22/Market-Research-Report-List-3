<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Two-Wheeler Knock Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Resonant Flat Response Knock Sensors</li><li>Non-Resonant Flat Response Knock Sensors</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Resonant flat response knock sensors are designed to detect engine knock by utilizing a resonant frequency to pick up vibrations in the engine. Non-resonant flat response knock sensors, on the other hand, do not rely on a specific frequency to detect knock but instead provide a flat response across a range of frequencies. Other types of knock sensors may include piezoelectric sensors or ionization sensors, each with their own unique method of detecting engine knock. These different types of knock sensors cater to various needs and preferences in the two-wheeler market.</p></p>
