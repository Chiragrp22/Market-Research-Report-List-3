<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rubber Anti-Tack Agents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Stearates</li><li>Fatty Acid Esters</li><li>Fatty Acid Amides</li><li>Soaps</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Rubber anti-tack agents are substances used to prevent the sticking of rubber during its processing and storage. They are categorized into different types, including stearates, fatty acid esters, fatty acid amides, and soaps. Stearates are derived from fatty acids and provide good lubrication, while fatty acid esters offer excellent release properties. Fatty acid amides function as anti-adhesives and reduce sticking. Soaps, on the other hand, are typically made from potassium or sodium salts of fatty acids and act as emulsifying agents. All these types serve to improve rubber processing and handling.</p></p>
