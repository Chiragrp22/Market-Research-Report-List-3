<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Peptide Vaccine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solution Phase Synthesis (SPS)</li><li>Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Peptide vaccines are divided into two main market types based on synthesis methods - Solution Phase Synthesis (SPS) and Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS). SPS involves the stepwise addition of amino acids in solution, followed by purification steps. SPPS, on the other hand, involves the stepwise addition of amino acids to a solid support, allowing for easier purification. Both methods have their advantages and limitations, making them suitable for different applications in the peptide vaccine market.</p></p>
