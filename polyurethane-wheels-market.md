<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polyurethane Wheels Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PPG Polyurethane Wheels</li><li>PTMEG Polyurethane Wheels</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polyurethane wheels can be classified into two main types based on the type of polyol used in their production: PPG polyurethane wheels and PTMEG polyurethane wheels. PPG polyurethane wheels are made using polypropylene glycol (PPG) as the polyol component, resulting in wheels that offer high abrasion and tear resistance. On the other hand, PTMEG polyurethane wheels are produced using polytetramethylene ether glycol (PTMEG) as the polyol component, providing enhanced load-bearing capacity and flexibility. Both types of polyurethane wheels cater to different market needs and requirements.</p></p>
