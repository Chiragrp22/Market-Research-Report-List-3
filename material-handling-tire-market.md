<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Material Handling Tire Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pneumatic Tires</li><li>Cushion Tires</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Material handling tires can be divided into two main categories: pneumatic tires and cushion tires. Pneumatic tires are made of rubber and filled with air, providing a cushioning effect that allows for smooth handling of heavy loads without causing damage to the flooring. Cushion tires, on the other hand, are solid rubber tires that provide stability and traction on smooth surfaces like concrete or asphalt. Both types of tires are essential for efficient and safe material handling in industries such as manufacturing, warehousing, and construction.</p></p>
