<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Distillers Corn Oil Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry-Milling</li><li>Wet-Milling</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Distillers corn oil is produced in two main types of markets: dry-milling and wet-milling. In the dry-milling market, corn is processed using high heat to break down the corn and extract the oil. This method produces a lower quality oil with higher levels of free fatty acids. In the wet-milling market, corn is soaked and ground to separate the components, resulting in a higher quality oil with lower levels of impurities. Both types of markets contribute to the overall production and availability of distillers corn oil.</p></p>
