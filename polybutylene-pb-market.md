<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polybutylene (PB) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Type I</li><li>Type II</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polybutylene (PB) is a type of plastic material commonly used in pipes for plumbing applications. There are two main market types for PB: Type I and Type II. Type I PB pipes were manufactured using a butene-1 monomer and were commonly used for plumbing systems in residential buildings in the 1970s and 1980s. Type II PB pipes, which were manufactured using a hexene-1 monomer, were developed later to address durability issues found in Type I pipes. Both types of PB pipes have since been largely replaced by more modern piping materials due to concerns over their long-term reliability.</p></p>
