<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Empennages Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Body Installation</li><li>Cruciform</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Empennages market types involve different configurations for the installation of the tail section of an aircraft. The body installation type involves attaching the empennage directly to the fuselage, typically seen in smaller aircraft. On the other hand, the cruciform market refers to a design where the empennage is arranged in a cruciform shape, with horizontal and vertical stabilizers intersecting. This configuration is commonly found in larger commercial and military aircraft, providing stability and control during flight. Both types cater to different aircraft sizes and purposes in the aviation industry.</p></p>
